# Guess-the-Number-Game-Python-Project-computer
This Python game lets you guess a number between 1 and 100. The computer picks the number, and you make guesses.  The game tells you if your guess is too high or too low. It counts your tries and congratulates you when you're right. If you enter something that's not a number, you can quit. The game ends when you guess correctly or choose to exit.
